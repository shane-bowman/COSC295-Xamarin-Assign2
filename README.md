**COSC295 Xamarin Mobile App**
**Overview**

This Xamarin Mobile App was developed for COSC295 at Saskatchewan Polytechnic as part of my coursework. Itâ€™s a cross-platform mobile application designed to track game matches, featuring database management and user-friendly interfaces. The app showcases my skills in mobile development and database integration and is included as an artifact in my TCOM 291 portfolio.

**Features**

Settings Page: Reset the database with hardcoded games for quick setup.

Opponent List: Display opponents with context menu deletion, including cascading match removal.

Matches Page: Add matches with game and date pickers for precise tracking.

Games Page: Show match totals for each game, integrated with a local database for dynamic data management.
